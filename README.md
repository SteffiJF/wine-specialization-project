# wine-specialization-project
Python and R code used in Specialization Project: Classifying Trends in Wine Sales using an LSTM Multi Class Classifier on Multivariate Time Series

Initial Study - the first look at the code, merging, analyzing missing values...

Differencing Analysis - examples of sales, products, and ranks file, testing differencing aggregated data vs aggregating differenced data

Processing - constructing two files, one containing aggregated sales der district and one containing top five wines per district

Machine Learning - constructing features and targets, preparing data for machine learning, and running LSTM models on different features and targets

ARIMA_baseline - r code used for making ARIMA forecasts of the timelines, calculating y-values, and exporting for further analysis in MachineLearning.ipynb
